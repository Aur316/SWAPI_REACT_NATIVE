# Star Wars Characters Search App

This React Native app allows users to search for Star Wars characters by name using the Star Wars API (SWAPI). It displays characters with blue eyes first (sorted alphabetically), followed by other characters, sorted by their creation date.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Search for Star Wars characters by name.
- **Sorting**: 
  - Characters with blue eyes are shown first, sorted alphabetically.
  - Other characters are listed next, sorted by creation date.
- **Pagination**: Choose how many characters to display per page (25, 50, 100, 150).
- **Testing**: Basic unit tests ensure search functionality works properly.

## Installation

   Run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
